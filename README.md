# Random Images
This is a very small project i made becuz i was bored.
This generates an GIF from randomly generated JPEG files.
## Usage
```bash
python3 main.py imageAmmount height width duration
```
```bash
python3 main.py 5 64 64 200
```
## Example GIF
![animated](https://github.com/KevinAlavik/RandomGIF/assets/95900603/fa663993-bab4-43d6-8e1b-ff27b0bfa420)
## Warning
You dont want a GIF with to many frames/images becuz it will be very big file a GIF with 120 frames is 48MB
## How it works
It randomly generates data URIs and downloads them and then put them together into an GIF
### Is it pronounced jif or gif?
